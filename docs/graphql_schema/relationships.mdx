GraphQLize identifies the relationships between database tables using their foreign keys, and generate appropriate relationship fields (connections) in the resulting GraphQL schema.

## One to One

![](/img/address_city_country_er_diagram.png)

For the database table relationships like above, GraphQLize infers two `one-to-one` relationships.

- An `address` is associated with a `city` via `city_id` column in the `address` table.

- A `city` is associated with a `country` via `country_id` column in the `city` table.

GraphQLize then create two object relationships in the `Address` and the `City` type respectively.

```graphql
type Address {
  # ...
  city: City!
}

type City {
  # ...
  country: Country!
}
```

The generated field name is the _camelCase_ version of the corresponding column name with the id suffix (`_id`) removed.

Here are some of the examples.

| Column Name            | GraphQL Field Name |
| ---------------------- | ------------------ |
| actor_id               | actor              |
| original_language_id   | originalLanguage   |
| reports_to_employee_id | reportsToEmployee  |

By default, GraphQLize assumes `_id` as the suffix for foreign keys in both Postgres and MySQL.

[In future](https://github.com/graphqlize/graphqlize/issues/4), GraphQLize will provide a configuration to override this default behaviour.

## One to Many

![](/img/address_city_country_er_diagram.png)

For the database table relationships like above, GraphQLize infers two `one-to-many` relationships.

- A `city` has many `address` (addresses) via `city_id` column in the `address` table.

- A `country` has many `city` (cities) via `country_id` column in the `city` table.

GraphQLize then create two array relationships in the `City` and the `Country` type respectively.

```graphql
type City {
  # ...
  addresses: [Address]!
}

type Country {
  # ...
  cities: [City]!
}
```

The generated field name is the _camelCase_ version of the corresponding target table's pluralized name.

If a table has multiple foreign keys to the same table as below,

<Tabs
  defaultValue="postgres"
  values={[
    { label: 'Postgres', value: 'postgres' },
    { label: 'MySQL', value: 'mysql' }
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="postgres">

```sql
CREATE TABLE language (
  language_id serial PRIMARY KEY,
  name character(20) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE film (
  film_id serial PRIMARY KEY,
  title character varying(255) NOT NULL,

  language_id smallint NOT NULL REFERENCES language(language_id),
  original_language_id smallint REFERENCES language(language_id)
);

```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="mysql">

```sql
CREATE TABLE language (
  language_id TINYINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  name CHAR(20) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (language_id)
);

CREATE TABLE film (
  film_id SMALLINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  language_id TINYINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
  original_language_id TINYINT UNSIGNED DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY  (film_id),
  CONSTRAINT fk_film_language FOREIGN KEY (language_id) REFERENCES language (language_id),
  CONSTRAINT fk_film_language_original FOREIGN KEY (original_language_id) REFERENCES language (language_id)
);
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

GraphQLize creates two `one-to-many` relationships between `language` and `films`. 

* The `language` has many `film` (films) via `language_id` column in the `film` table. 
* The `language` has many `film` (films) via `original_language_id` column in the `film` table.

```graphql
type Language {
  languageId: Int!
  name: String!

  films: [Film]!
  originalLanguageFilms: [Film]!
}
```

The nomenclature used here to generate the field name follows the below logic.

If the column name (`language_id`) after the removal of the foreign key suffix (`language`) matches the source table name, then the resulting field name is the *camelCase* version of the pluralized form of the  table (`films`).

If the column name (`original_language_id`) after the removal of the foreign key suffix (`original_language`) did not match the source table name, then GraphQLize removes the foreign key suffix and concatenate with the pluralized form of the target table and then convert it to its *camelCase* version (`originalLanguageFilms`).

## Many to Many

The `many-to-many` relationship is a bit tricky to figure out. 

GraphQLize traverses each table's metadata to figure out whether it is an [associative table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_entity) or not. 

A table is considered as an associative table if it satisfies the following two criteria

1. It should have a primary key made of two columns.
2. These primary key columns should be a subset of the foreign key columns present in that table. 

For the database table relationships like below,

![](/img/film_actor_er_diagram.png)

The `film_actor` table is an associative table as

1. It has `actor_id` and `film_id` as the primary keys.
2. The primay keys `{actor_id, film_id}` is a subset of foreign keys `{actor_id, film_id}` of the `film_actor` table. 

In this scenario, GraphQLize creates two array fields for these two `many-to-many` relationships.  

```graphql
type Film {
  actors: [Actor]!
  # ...
}
type Actor {
  films: [Film]!
  # ...
}
```

For the relationships between `film` & `film_actor` and `film_actor` & `actor` tables, GraphQLize creates the following fields. 

```graphql
type Film {
  # ...
  filmActors: [FilmActor]!
}

type FilmActor {
  actor: Actor!
  film: Film!
  # ...
}

type Actor {
  # ...
  filmActors: [FilmActor]!
}
```
