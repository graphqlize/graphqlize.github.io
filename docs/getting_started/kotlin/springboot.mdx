Getting started with GraphQLize in Kotlin Spring-Boot is simple and straight forward.

As we typically do, let's go to [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/) and create a Kotlin project with Web & JPA as dependencies. This documentation uses this [Spring Initializr Template](https://start.spring.io/#!type=gradle-project&language=kotlin&platformVersion=2.2.5.RELEASE&packaging=jar&jvmVersion=1.8&groupId=org.graphqlize&artifactId=kotlin-spring-boot-demo&name=kotlin-spring-boot-demo&description=Demo%20project%20for%20Spring%20Boot&packageName=org.graphqlize.kotlin-spring-boot-demo&dependencies=web,data-jpa).

## Adding Dependencies

The first step is to add the `graphqlize-java` & the JDBC driver dependencies.

[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/org.graphqlize/graphqlize-java.svg)](https://clojars.org/org.graphqlize/graphqlize-java)

```kotlin {4,8}
// ...
repositories {
  // ...
  maven(url= "https://clojars.org/repo")
}
dependencies {
  // ...
  implementation("org.graphqlize:graphqlize-java:0.1.0-alpha20")
  // For Postgres
  implementation("org.postgresql:postgresql:42.2.10")
  // For MySQL
  implementation("mysql:mysql-connector-java:8.0.19")
}
// ...
```

## Initializing GraphQLizeResolver

The next step is initializing `GraphQLizeResolver`. To do it, let's a create new file _GraphQLizeResolverProvider.kt_ and add the following code to expose the `GraphQLizeResolver` spring-boot bean.

```kotlin {8,10,12,13}
package org.graphqlize.kotlinspringbootdemo

import org.graphqlize.java.GraphQLizeResolver
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component
import javax.sql.DataSource

@Component
class GraphQLizeResolverProvider(dataSource : DataSource) {
  val graphQLizeResolver = GraphQLizeResolver(dataSource)

  @Bean
  fun graphQLizeResolver() = graphQLizeResolver
}
```

During initialization (via `constructor`), the `GraphQLizeResolver` reads the metadata of the database using the JDBC metadata APIs and keeps an in-memory representation of them.

:::note
Currently, it takes around 8 to 12 seconds to initialize. I am planning to [work on it](https://github.com/graphqlize/graphqlize/issues/48) in a future release.

### Configuring DataSource

To configure the `DataSource`, let's add the following properties in the _application.properties_ file

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

<Tabs
  defaultValue="postgres"
  values={[
    { label: 'Postgres', value: 'postgres' },
    { label: 'MySQL', value: 'mysql' }
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="postgres">

```
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/sakila
spring.datasource.username=postgres
spring.datasource.password=postgres
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="mysql">

```
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/sakila
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=mysql
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note
Make sure you are changing the above values to refer your database connection. The above example assumes that you are using the _sakila_ database created from this [JOOQ's example repository](https://github.com/jOOQ/jOOQ/tree/master/jOOQ-examples/Sakila).  
:::


## Adding GraphQL Endpoint

The final step is exposing an API endpoint for handling the GraphQL request. To do it, let's create a new file _GraphQLController.kt_ and do the following 

* Create a data class `GraphQLRequest` for deserializing GraphQL request from the client.
* Create a Controller class with a `GraphQLResolver` dependency. 
* Create a method inside this class to handle the GraphQL request. 

```kotlin {16,18,19,22,23}
package org.graphqlize.kotlinspringbootdemo

import com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonCreator
import org.graphqlize.java.GraphQLResolver
import org.springframework.http.*
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*

data class GraphQLRequest @JsonCreator constructor(
  val query: String,
  val variables: Map<String, Any>?
)

@RestController
class GraphQLController(val graphQLResolver: GraphQLResolver) {

  @PostMapping("/graphql")
  fun handle(@RequestBody gqlReq: GraphQLRequest): ResponseEntity<String> {
    val result =
      graphQLResolver.resolve(gqlReq.query, gqlReq.variables)

    return ResponseEntity.ok()
            .header(HttpHeaders.CONTENT_TYPE, "application/json")
            .body(result);
  }
}
```

Handling the GraphQL request is as simple as highlighted above. 

Get the query & the variables from the request and invoke the `resolve` method on the initialized instance of `GraphQLizeResolver`. 

It returns the `result` as stringified JSON, and we are sending it as response body with the content type as `application/json`. 

### Test Drive

To a test drive of this implementation, start the server and hit the endpoint via curl.

```bash
> curl -X POST \
  --data '{"query": "query { actorByActorId(actorId: 1){firstName}}"}' \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  http://localhost:8080/graphql
```

You'll get a response like below.

```json
{
  "data": {
    "actorByActorId": {
      "firstName": "PENELOPE"
    }
  }
}
```

## GraphQL Playground and Voyager

With the GraphQL endpoint up and running, the next step is introspecting the GraphQL schema and try out some more queries. 

To introspect, we are going to make use of [Voyager](https://github.com/APIs-guru/graphql-voyager), a tool to visualize GraphQL API as an interactive graph. Adding it to our project is easy thanks to [static content serve capability](https://spring.io/blog/2013/12/19/serving-static-web-content-with-spring-boot) of Spring Boot. 

All you need to do is download this [voyager.html](https://github.com/graphqlize/graphqlize-demo/blob/master/kotlin/spring-boot/src/main/resources/static/voyager.html) file and put it under the _src/main/resources/static_ directory. 

When you restart the server, the Voyager will be available at _http://localhost:8080/voyager.html_. A sample output would look like [this](https://www.graphqlize.org/html/sakila-voyager.html).

Then to interact with the GraphQL API, let's add the [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/prisma-labs/graphql-playground). Like Voyager, download this [playground.html](https://github.com/graphqlize/graphqlize-demo/blob/master/kotlin/spring-boot/src/main/resources/static/playground.html) file and put in the _static_ directory. 

This GraphQL playground will be available at _http://localhost:8080/playground.html_ after server restart.

## Next Steps

Congrats! You are on course to build impressive applications using GraphQLize in less time. To save yourself some more time, do refer [this documentation](/docs/graphql_schema/types-and-fields) to know more about how GraphQLize generates the GraphQL schema and the queries. 

The sample code is available in [this GitHub Repository](https://github.com/graphqlize/graphqlize-demo/tree/master/kotlin/spring-boot).

:::note
You can also customize certain default behaviours of GraphQLize in future releases.
