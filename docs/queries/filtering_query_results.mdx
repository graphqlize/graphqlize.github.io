You can filter the query results in GraphQLize using the `where` argument. 

## Comparison Operators

### Equal To, Not Equal To

```graphql
query {
  # highlight-next-line
  cities(where: {cityId: {eq: 3}}) {
    city
  }
}
```

```graphql
query {
  # highlight-next-line
  languages(where: {name: {neq: "English"}}) {
    name
  }
}
```

### Greater Than, Greater Than Or Equal To

```graphql
query {
  # highlight-next-line
  payments(where: {amount: {gt: 11.99}}) {
    rentalId
    amount
  }
}
```
```graphql
query {
  # highlight-next-line
  payments(where: {amount: {gte: 11.99}}) {
    rentalId
    amount
  }
}
```
### Less Than, Less Than Or Equal To

```graphql
query {
  # highlight-next-line
  payments(where: {amount: {lt: 6.99}}) {
    rentalId
    amount
  }
}
```

```graphql
query {
  # highlight-next-line
  payments(where: {amount: {lte: 6.99}}) {
    rentalId
    amount
  }
}
```

### Between

```graphql
query {
  # highlight-next-line
  payments(where: {paymentDate: {between: {from: "2005-08-23T21:00:00", to: "2005-08-23T21:03:00"}}}) {
    rentalId
  }
}
```

### Is Null, Is Not Null

```graphql
query {
  # highlight-next-line
  employees(where: {employeeReportsToId: {isNull: true}}) {
    firstName
    lastName
  }
}
```

```graphql
query {
  # highlight-next-line
  employees(where: {employeeReportsToId: {isNotNull: true}}) {
    firstName
    lastName
  }
}
```

### IN, NOT IN

```graphql
query {
  # highlight-next-line
  payments(where: {customerId: {in: [1, 2]}}) {
    paymentId
    amount
  }
}
```

```graphql
query {
  # highlight-next-line
  payments(where: {customerId: {notIn: [1, 2]}}) {
    paymentId
    amount
  }
}
```

### String Comparison

#### Like

```graphql
query {
  # highlight-next-line
  countries(where: {country: {like: "A%"}}) {
    country
  }
}
```
#### Not Like
```graphql
query {
  # highlight-next-line
  countries(where: {country: {notLike: "A%"}}) {
    country
  }
}
```

## Logical Operators

### AND

```graphql
query {
  # payments of a customer with the id `1` 
  # and amount greater than `5.99`
  # highlight-next-line
  payments(where: {and: {customerId: {eq: 1}, amount: {gt: 5.99}}}) {
    paymentId
    amount
  }
}
```

`and` also supports list of conditions. 

The above query can be rewritten as

```graphql
query {
  # highlight-next-line 
  payments(where: {and: [{customerId: {eq: 1}, amount: {gt: 5.99}}]}) {
    paymentId
    amount
  }
}
```

### OR

`or` is similar to `and` in syntax. It accepts both a single condition or a list of conditions. 

```graphql
query {
  # languages with the name either "English" or "French"
  # highlight-next-line
  languages(where: {or: [{name: {eq: "English"}}, {name: {eq: "French"}}]}) {
    languageId
    name
  }
}
```

### NOT

Using the `not` operator we can invert the filter condition. 

```graphql
query {
  # languages with the name except "English" or "French"
  # highlight-next-line
  languages(where: {not: {or: [{name: {eq: "English"}}, {name: {eq: "French"}}]}}) {
    languageId
    name
  }
}
```

## Filter by nested object(s)

We can filter the resulting objects based on the fields of a nested object(s).

### One to One

![](/img/address_city_country_er_diagram.png)

For example, to get all the cities of a county using the country' name in the above schema, We can query it as 

```graphql
query {
  # highlight-next-line
  cities(where: {country: {country: {eq : "Algeria"}}}) {
    cityId
    city
  }
}
```

### One to Many

If the nested object has `one-to-many` relationship with its parent, the filter condition yield the results if **at-least one** of the nested object's field(s) satisfy the condition.

For the above schema, we can get a list of countries which has at-least one city that starts with `Ab` using the below query.

```graphql
query {
  # returns countries which has at-least one city 
  # with the name like 'AB%'
  # highlight-next-line
  countries(where: {cities: {city: {like: "Ab%"}}}) {
    countryId
    country
  }
}
```

### Many to Many

A filter based on a nested object with the `many-to-many` relationship behaves the same as that of `one-to-many`.

![](/img/film_actor_er_diagram.png)

For the above schema, to get the actors who are part of **at-lease** one film which has the word `LIFE` in its title.

```graphql
query {
  # highlight-next-line
  actors(where: {films: {title: {:like "%LIFE%"}}}) {
    firstName
    lastName
  }
}
```

#### Filter to check all objects satisfy a condition.

Let's assume that we have a schema like below 

![](/img/author_course_er_diagram.png)

To filter authors who has **at-least** one course with the rating `5`, we can achieve it using the following query.

```graphql
query {
  # highlight-next-line
  authors(where: {courses : {rating: {eq: 5}}}) {
    firstName
    lastName
  }
}
```

If we want to filter only the authors who has got the rating `5` in **all** their courses, we can achieve it by

```graphql
query {
  # highlight-next-line
  authors(where: {not: {courses : {rating: {neq: 5}}}}) {
    firstName
    lastName
  }
}
```

We are making use of [SQL anti-join](https://gerardnico.com/data/type/relation/sql/anti_join) by inverting the whole condition using `not` and complementing the inner condition using its reverse (`neq` in the place of `eq`).

## Filtering nested objects

GraphQLize also supports filtering nested objects. 

```graphql
query {
  countryByCountryId(countryId: 2) {
    country
    # filter one-to-many relationship
    # highlight-next-line
    cities(where: {city: {like: "B%"}}) {
      cityId
      city
    }
  }
}
```

```graphql
query {
  actorByActorId(actorId: 148) {
    firstName
    # filter many-to-many relationship
    # highlight-next-line
    films(where: {title: {like: "S%"}}) {
      title
    }
  }
}
```
