Hello World, 

The third iteration of [GraphQLize](https://www.graphqlize.org) went well as planned and the filters in GraphQLize just got better :). 

Let's take a peek at what's new in GraphQLize and what is in the pipeline for the next two weeks.

<!--truncate-->

## Logical Operators

Now we can use logical operators `and`, `or` and `not` in the filters.

### AND

```graphql
query {
  # payments of a customer with the id `1` 
  # and amount greater than `5.99`
  # highlight-next-line
  payments(where: {and: {customerId: {eq: 1}, amount: {gt: 5.99}}}) {
    paymentId
    amount
  }
}
```

`and` also supports list of conditions. 

The above query can be rewritten as

```graphql
query {
  # highlight-next-line 
  payments(where: {and: [{customerId: {eq: 1}, amount: {gt: 5.99}}]}) {
    paymentId
    amount
  }
}
```

### OR

`or` is similar to `and` in syntax. It accepts both a single condition or a list of conditions. 

```graphql
query {
  # languages with the name either "English" or "French"
  # highlight-next-line
  languages(where: {or: [{name: {eq: "English"}}, {name: {eq: "French"}}]}) {
    languageId
    name
  }
}
```

### NOT

Using the `not` operator we can invert the filter condition. 

```graphql
query {
  # languages with the name except "English" or "French"
  # highlight-next-line
  languages(where: {not: {or: [{name: {eq: "English"}}, {name: {eq: "French"}}]}}) {
    languageId
    name
  }
}
```

## Filter by nested object(s)

Another major feature that was added during the last iteration is filtering the resulting objects based on the fields of a nested object(s).

### One to One

![](/img/address_city_country_er_diagram.png)

For example, to get all the cities of a country using the country's name in the above schema, We can query it as 

```graphql
query {
  # highlight-next-line
  cities(where: {country: {country: {eq : "Algeria"}}}) {
    cityId
    city
  }
}
```

### One to Many

If the nested object has `one-to-many` relationship with its parent, the filter condition yield the results if **at-least one** of the nested object's field(s) satisfy the condition.

For the above schema, we can get a list of countries which has at-least one city that starts with `Ab` using the below query.

```graphql
query {
  # returns countries which has at-least one city 
  # with the name like 'AB%'
  # highlight-next-line
  countries(where: {cities: {city: {like: "Ab%"}}}) {
    countryId
    country
  }
}
```

### Many to Many

A filter based on a nested object with the `many-to-many` relationship behaves the same as that of `one-to-many`.

![](/img/film_actor_er_diagram.png)

For the above schema, to get the actors who are part of **at-lease** one film which has the word `LIFE` in its title.

```graphql
query {
  # highlight-next-line
  actors(where: {films: {title: {:like "%LIFE%"}}}) {
    firstName
    lastName
  }
}
```

Let's assume that we have a schema like below 

![](/img/author_course_er_diagram.png)

To filter authors who has **at-least** one course with the rating `5`, we can achieve it using the following query.

```graphql
query {
  # highlight-next-line
  authors(where: {courses : {rating: {eq: 5}}}) {
    firstName
    lastName
  }
}
```

If we want to filter only the authors who has got the rating `5` in **all** their courses, we can achieve it by

```graphql
query {
  # highlight-next-line
  authors(where: {not: {courses : {rating: {neq: 5}}}}) {
    firstName
    lastName
  }
}
```

We are making use of [SQL anti-join](https://gerardnico.com/data/type/relation/sql/anti_join) here by inverting the whole condition using `not` and complementing the inner condition using its reverse (`neq` in the place of `eq`).

### Existence Check

GraphQLize provides a special filter parameter `have` to filter based on the existence of child objects. For example, in the above schema, if we'd like to filter only the authors who have courses, it can be achieved using the following query.

```graphql
query {
  # highlight-next-line
  authors(where: {have: courses}) {
    firstName
    lastName
  }
}
```

Suppose, if we want to filter authors who don't have `courses`, we can make use of the `not` in addition to `have` in the filter.

```graphql
query {
  # highlight-next-line
  authors(where: {not: {have:courses}}) {
    firstName
    lastName
  }
}
```

> The `have` parameter is available only in the `one-to-many` and `many-to-many` relationship fields


## What's Next?

The focus of the next iteration of GraphQLize is adding support for SQL aggregate functions.
