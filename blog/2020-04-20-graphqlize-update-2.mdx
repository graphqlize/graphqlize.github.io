Hello World, 

GraphQLize is [one month old now](https://www.graphqlize.org/blog/announcing-graphqlize-alpha) 🎂, and it is getting better day by day. Almost 50% of the planned features are complete 🙌. 

As usual in this blog post, I am going to share what's new in GraphQLize and what is in the pipeline for the next two weeks.

Here we go!

## Sorting 

GraphQLize now enables sorting the query results using the `orderBy` argument. By default, you can use any of the table columns to sort the query results. In future, we can control this behaviour.

```graphql
query languagesSortedByName {
  # sorts using the `name` column in the `language` table
  # highlight-next-line
  languages(orderBy: {name: ASC}) {
    name
  }
}
```

If you'd like to sort it in descending order, replace `ASC` with `DESC`. 

```graphql
query languagesSortedByNameInDescOrder {
  # highlight-next-line
  languages(orderBy: {name: DESC}) {
    name
  }
}
```

We can sort by multiple columns as well,

```graphql
query {
  # sorts the `actor` table by the `first_name` column 
  # and then by `last_name` column in descending order
  # highlight-next-line
  actors(orderBy: {firstName: ASC, lastName: DESC}) {
    firstName
    lastName
  }
}
```

GraphQLize also supports sorting nested objects. 

```graphql
query {
  countryByCountryId(countryId: 2) {
    country
    # sorting one-to-many relationship
    # highlight-next-line
    cities(orderBy: {city: DESC}) {
      city
    }
  }
}
```

```graphql
query {
  actorByActorId(actorId: 148) {
    firstName
    # sorting many-to-many relationship
    # highlight-next-line
    films(orderBy: {title: DESC}) {
      title
    }
  }
}
```

:::note
Currently, sorting nested objects in MySQL is not supported. [It'll be fixed](https://github.com/graphqlize/graphqlize/issues/52) in a later release. 
:::

## Filtering

Filtering is another critical feature that was released in the last iteration. Like `orderBy` in sorting, we have the `where` argument using which we can specify the `filter` condition.

Here are some of the examples of using `eq`, `in`, `isNull` and `between` filter conditions.

```graphql
query {
  # highlight-next-line
  cities(where: {cityId: {eq: 3}}) {
    city
  }
}
```

```graphql
query {
  # highlight-next-line
  payments(where: {customerId: {in: [1, 2]}}) {
    paymentId
    amount
  }
}
```

```graphql
query {
  # highlight-next-line
  employees(where: {employeeReportsToId: {isNull: true}}) {
    firstName
    lastName
  }
}
```

```graphql
query {
  # highlight-next-line
  payments(where: {paymentDate: {between: {from: "2005-08-23T21:00:00", to: "2005-08-23T21:03:00"}}}) {
    rentalId
  }
}
```

For the detailed set of supported filter conditions, you can check out [this documentation](https://www.graphqlize.org/docs/queries/filtering-query-results).

We can filter the nested objects also. 

```graphql
query {
  countryByCountryId(countryId: 2) {
    country
    # filter one-to-many relationship
    # highlight-next-line
    cities(where: {city: {like: "B%"}}) {
      cityId
      city
    }
  }
}
```

```graphql
query {
  actorByActorId(actorId: 148) {
    firstName
    # filter many-to-many relationship
    # highlight-next-line
    films(where: {title: {like: "S%"}}) {
      title
    }
  }
}
```

## MySQL Boolean Data Type Support

The last feature that was developed as part of the previous iteration is the support for MySQL `boolean` data type. 

GraphQLize treats the column types `BIT(1)` and `TINYINT(1)` as the `Boolean` GraphQL scalar type. 

Here is an example of using it in a filter condition to filter only `active` customers. 

```graphql
query { 
  # highlight-next-line
  customers(where: {active: {eq: true}}) { 
    firstName 
  } 
}
```

## What's Next?

I am planning to take a short break for two days to sustain my progress and energy level. Then, I am going to work on the following issues for the next two weeks. 

* Supporting [and](https://github.com/graphqlize/graphqlize/issues/28), [or](https://github.com/graphqlize/graphqlize/issues/29) and [not](https://github.com/graphqlize/graphqlize/issues/34) operators in the filter conditions.

* Ability to filter based on the nested object's fields - [GitHub Issue #33](https://github.com/graphqlize/graphqlize/issues/33)

* Filter based on the existence of nested objects - [GitHub Issue #38](https://github.com/graphqlize/graphqlize/issues/38)

> I am keeping this iteration light as I may not be able to spend some good quality time outside my work hours. In case, if I am free, I would take some more features around filtering. Let's see how it goes 🤞.

You can keep track of the progress by

That's all!
