Hello World, 

Thank you, everyone, for the words of praise and encouragement during the [announcement of GraphQLize](https://www.graphqlize.org/blog/announcing-graphqlize-alpha) two weeks ago. I am glad to see 100+ ⭐️s in GitHub. [GraphQLize](https://github.com/graphqlize/graphqlize) is my first-ever OSS project which achieved this tiny milestone. The journey just began, and a long way to go!

I am working on a biweekly iteration and as planned completed by the first iteration of GraphQLize. In this blog post, I am going to share what's new in GraphQLize and what is in the pipeline for the next iteration.

## Pagination via offset and limit

Using `offset` and `limit` parameters to paginate data is one of the most widely used techniques for pagination. GraphQLize supports these parameters to paginate the `table` or `view` queries. 

For a table like below,


import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

<Tabs
  defaultValue="postgres"
  values={[
    { label: 'Postgres', value: 'postgres' },
    { label: 'MySQL', value: 'mysql' }
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="postgres">

```sql
CREATE TABLE actor (
  actor_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  first_name character varying(45) NOT NULL,
  last_name character varying(45) NOT NULL
);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="mysql">

```sql
CREATE TABLE actor (
  actor_id SMALLINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  first_name VARCHAR(45) NOT NULL,
  last_name VARCHAR(45) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY  (actor_id)
)
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

GraphQLize provides out of the box GraphQL API with pagination supported via `offset` and `limit`, and we can query the `actor` table like below

```graphql
query {
  # highlight-next-line
  actors(limit: 2, offset: 2) {
    actorId
    firstName
    lastName
  }
}
```

The JSON result for the above query would look like 

```json
{
  "data": {
    "actors": [
      {
        "actorId": 3,
        "firstName": "ED",
        "lastName": "CHASE"
      },
      {
        "actorId": 4,
        "firstName": "JENNIFER",
        "lastName": "DAVIS"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Pagination of nested objects

GraphQLize also supports pagination of nested objects.

### One to Many Relationships

![](/img/address_city_country_er_diagram.png)

```graphql {4}
query {
  countryByCountryId(countryId: 6) {
    country
    cities(limit: 2, offset : 4) {
      city
    }
  }
}
```


### Many to Many Relationships

![](/img/film_actor_er_diagram.png)

```graphql {4}
query {
  actorByActorId(actorId: 1) {
    firstName
    films(limit: 5, offset: 5) {
      title
    }
  }
}
```

## Custom Scalar Types

The latest release of GraphQLize adds supports for the following custom scalar types in addition to the standard GraphQL [scalar types](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#scalar-types).

* [Long](/docs/graphql_schema/custom-scalar-types#long)
* [BigDecimal](/docs/graphql_schema/custom-scalar-types#bigdecimal)
* [Date](/docs/graphql_schema/custom-scalar-types#date)
* [Time](/docs/graphql_schema/custom-scalar-types#time)
* [TimeWithTimeZone](/docs/graphql_schema/custom-scalar-types#timewithtimezone)
* [DateTime](/docs/graphql_schema/custom-scalar-types#datetime)
* [DateTimeWithTimeZone](/docs/graphql_schema/custom-scalar-types#datetimwithtimezone)

> Refer the respective documentation to more the about the database column types that these scalar types map to.


## Scala & Kotlin Support

One of the core design goals of GraphQLize is not to tie to any web development framework and remain as a drop-in library in any JVM language projects. 

Here is the new documentation of how to use GraphQLize in Scala & Kotlin.

* Scala
  - [Scalatra](/docs/getting_started/scala/scalatra)
* Kotlin
  - [Spring Boot](/docs/getting_started/kotlin/springboot)
  - [Ktor](/docs/getting_started/kotlin/ktor)

:::note
I am looking for some help on creating a sample web application using Play framework in Scala. If you'd look like to contribute, feel free to create a pull request. Thanks in advance :)

## What's Next?

There are close to [35+ feature enhancements](https://github.com/graphqlize/graphqlize/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Acreated-asc) that I am planning for the v1.0 (production-ready) release. For the next iteration, I am planning to work on the below ones.

* [Boolean data type support in MySQL](https://github.com/graphqlize/graphqlize/issues/10)
* [Add Sorting](https://github.com/graphqlize/graphqlize/issues/7)
* [Add Sorting in nested objects](https://github.com/graphqlize/graphqlize/issues/18)
* [Add Equality Filter For Numeric Types](https://github.com/graphqlize/graphqlize/issues/19)

> If you are wondering why only four, I am developing GraphQLize in addition to my day job (and lockdown), and I don't want to commit more and deliver less :)
